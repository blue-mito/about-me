## About Me, with a guessing game

This site was created for all of my friends at Code Fellows to get to know me a little better.
There is even a quiz of *seven* questions to test your knowledge.
A score variable was added so users can easily track their performance.

### Reflections and Comments

- The biggest takeaway I have had from this project at this point has been the practice with CSS, especially some of the more complex properties that are associated with polishing up the appearance of the site. An example that comes to mind is making a background photo appear and look good.

- As the JavaScript has become more complex to include arrays and loops, I learned how to better format my code and place the correct lines of code within the correct brackets to get the intended effect for the user.
