    <h1>It's All About Me!</h1>
    <h2>Well, at least the web page is</h2>
    <p>My name is Derek. I'm thirty years old and live in San Antonio, TX with my wife and two daughters (is this a <em
        class="italics">Wheel
        of Fortune</em> intro?). I grew up in the polar opposite of Texas in the frozen tundra of Western New York, on
      the white-capped
      shores of Lake Ontario. Living in the Great Lakes region was <em class="italics">incredible</em> as a kid. I spent
      most of my free
      time fly fishing for trout and smallmouth bass (depending on the season), sailing, or playing in the peach
      orchards behind my house. When I wasn't outside, I was most likely
      reading a book, playing video games, or Dungeons and Dragons with friends.</p>

    <p>When I graduated high school, I really had no clue of what I wanted to do for a career. I went to college--a few
      times--but without a clear direction, my motivation wavered. On a trip hitchhiking down the East Coast with a
      friend, I decided that I would consider joining the military when I returned home. After a few trips bouncing back
      and forth from the Air Force to Navy recruiters, I signed on the dotted line to become a Cryptologic Linguist in
      the USAF.</p>

    <p>To be honest, <em class="italics">cryptology</em> is a bit of a misnomer for my career field. Linguist is really
      the word in the
      combination to focus on. After passing some tests, including one that measures language-learning aptitude, I was
      sent first to Basic Military Training, and then on to the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, CA to learn a
      foreign language. A year later, I left the pacific paradise of Monterey Bay fluent in my assigned language.</p>

    <p>Fast forward ten years, and here we are today. I spent six years as a linguist and the last four as a Military
      Training Instructor at Basic Military Training. I now begin my adventure into tech, and hopefully
      a future career as a software developer, as a student at Code Fellows.</p>
